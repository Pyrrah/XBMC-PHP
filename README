|    XBMC PHP Library - (C) Kai Gohegan, 2010   |
+-----------------------------------------------+
		
A PHP library for interacting with XBMC using
JSON-RPC and XBMC's HTTP-API. Inspiration was
drawn from Jason Bryant-Greene's php-json-rpc
(https://bitbucket.org/jbg/php-json-rpc/src).

+-----------------------------------------------+
		
First, include the xbmc.php file:
include("xbmc.php");
	
Next, create the two classes in one of the below formats:
		
1. Pass the URL parameters as an array
		
	$xbmcHost = new xbmcHost(array('host' => '0.0.0.0', 'port' => '8080', 'user' => 'username', 'pass' => 'password'));
	$xbmcJson = new xbmcJson($xbmcHost);
	$xbmcHttp = new xbmcHttp($xbmcHost);
		
2. Pass the URL as a string:
	
	$xbmcHost = new xbmcHost('username:password@IP:Port');
	$xbmcJson = new xbmcJson($xbmcHost);
	$xbmcHttp = new xbmcHttp($xbmcHost);
	
Then you can start making calls:
		
JSON-RPC API (http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=JSON_RPC)
Commands are sent using the following syntax:

$xbmcJson->NAMESPACE->COMMAND(array(PARAM1 => VALUE1, PARAM2 => VALUE2, etc..));

eg: $xbmcJson->VideoLibrary->GetRecentlyAddedMovies();
						
HTTP-API API (http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Web_Server_HTTP_API)

Commands are sent using the following syntax:

$xbmcHttp->COMMAND("Parameter string in quotes. The string is automatically url-encoded.");

eg: $xbmcHttp->ExecBuiltIn("Notification(XBMC-PHP, Hello!)");
